When it comes to terminals, I've worked hands on with solutions including Git
Bash, ConEmu, and Terminus. One aspect I typically look out for when
experimenting with new terminals is its _plugins_ ecosystem. In other words, is
there an open-source community of indivduals adding opt-in functionality on top
of the base terminal. A great example of this can be seen within the new
terminal I began working with known as [Hyper Terminal][hyper]. Here are some
plugins I currently use:

## hyperlinks

Saving clicks and mouse movements can go a long way. This plugin gives the
ability to directly click _external links_ within the terminal and opens them
within your default browser.

## hyper-alt-click

A common annoyance I find when dealing with terminals is not being able to
_click_ and place my cursor anywhere within the current line(s) of text. This
plugin solves that very problem.

## hyperline

This plugin offers some additional PC _metrics_ at the footer of your terminal.
Some include your CPU utilization, network speed, and battery percentage.

## hyper-search

Personally, one of the most convenient/quickest solutions for _searching_ data
within a large chunk of text is the ole' handy CTRL+F. This plugin provides the
same functionality for searching text across your current terminal instance's
history.

## hypercwd

Typically when I'm opening a terminal, its usually to run some code. When
organizing my directory structure on my PC, I tend to place all files that are
code related under some root _directory_. Because of this, every time I open a
new terminal, I have to navigate multiple directories to get to where I desire.
With this plugin, you can easily set your starting direcory when opening the
terminal.

## Remarks

There are dozens of other plugins available for Hyper Terminal. If your
interested in the plugins mentioned above, please consider checking out my
current configuration which can be found [here][gist].
