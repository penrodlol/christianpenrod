Blog posts are a key component in learning new technologies accross the web.
With [OpenAI's GPT][openai-gpt], we can take this a step further by instantly
summarizing blog posts into a few sentences. Allowing quicker consumption while
retaining the key concepts and takeaways.

In this article, we will learn how to _scrape_ blog post content and _summarize_
it using OpenAI's GPT.

## Setup

Before getting started, please ensure you have an OpenAI account. If not, you
can signup on their website [here][openai-signup]. Once signed up, take note of
your **API Key** as we will need it later.

> This project will be using [Node.js][nodejs-download]. Please ensure you have
> it installed and a basic understanding of its purpose before continuing.

Let's begin by initializing our project and installing the dependencies:

```bash
# Create the project directory and navigating into it
mkdir summarize-blog-posts-with-openai-gpt && cd $_
# Initialize project
npm init -y
# Install dependencies
npm i openai gpt-3-encoder cheerio user-agents dotenv

# If your using TypeScript, create a tsconfig and install dependencies
npx tsc --init
npm i typescript @types/node @types/user-agents
```

Now that we have our project setup with dependencies, let's create an `.env`
file where we can put our secret OpenAI API Key we took note of earlier.

```bash
# .env

OPENAI_API_KEY='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

Next, create an `index.ts` file at the root of our project. Within this file, we
can load our `.env` file and initialize the OpenAI API client.

```ts
// index.ts

import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai';

dotenv.config();

const configuration = new Configuration({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
```

## Web Scraping Content

Before attempting to summarize a blog post, we must first capture its contents.
Start by using the [Fetch API][fetch-api] to get all HTML content from the blog
post.

> Fetch API is baked into Node.js 18.x by default. Please ensure your local
> Node.js version is 18.x or higher.

```ts {1-10}
// index.ts

import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai';

dotenv.config();

const configuration = new Configuration({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

const url = 'https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis';
const html = await fetch(url).then((res) => res.text());
```
