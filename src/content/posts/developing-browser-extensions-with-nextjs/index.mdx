Although modern browsers offer a plethora of tooling to help assist web
development and general productivity, there will always be some niche
solution(s) not offered. How do we solve this? _Extensions!_

For the following example, we will showcase how easy it is to bundle a Next.js
application within a browser extension that's compatible with all Chromium-based
browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave) and Firefox.

It's worth mentioning that by using a rich framework like Next.js, we unlock the
ablity to create and scale a more complex web application. All embedded within a
browser extension.

## Setup

Lets begin by creating our Next.js application:

```bash
yarn create next-app demo-nextjs-browser-extension  --typescript

# All Chromium-based browsers.
yarn add -D @types/chrome

# Firefox.
yarn add -D @types/firefox-webext-browser
```

Now that we have our application, let add some dimensions to our body tag. This
will determine the size of the popup window when clicking on the extension's
icon within the browser's toolbar.

> The max dimensions allowed via Chromium browsers and Firefox is _800x600_
> pixels. [Chromium Source][chromium-dimensions] | [Firefox
> Source][firefox-dimensions]

```scss title="styles/globals.scss"
body {
  width: 500px;
  min-height: 600px;
}
```

## Update Template

Once our dimensions are in place, lets update the template within our
application. For the following example, we will keep it simple but do note; we
could make a much more complex application with the help of a framework like
Next.js.

```tsx title="pages/index.tsx"
import type { NextPage } from 'next';

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <section>
        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>This is a Next.js application. ðŸ˜Ž</p>
      </section>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

## Configuring The Manifest

Within all extensions, there exists a `manifest.json` file. Think of this file
as the configuration file. It contains the extension's metadata and security
permissions as well as a pointer to our Next.js application. Let's now add this
file to our Next.js app's `/public` directory:

<div>
  <details>
    <summary>Chrome</summary>
    ```json title="public/manifest.json"    
    {
      "name": "Next.js Browser Extension Demo",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "manifest_version": 3,
      "action": {
        "default_title": "Next.js Browser Extension Demo",
        "default_popup": "index.html"
      }
    }
    ```
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Firefox/Edge/Opera/Brave</summary>
    ```json title="public/manifest.json"    
    {
      "name": "Next.js Browser Extension Demo",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "manifest_version": 2,
      "browser_action": {
        "default_title": "Next.js Browser Extension Demo",
        "default_popup": "index.html"
      }
    }
    ```
  </details>
</div>

Before moving further, lets break down the contents of the manifest.json file.
To begin, we have the `name` and `version`. Each are simply metadata for the
extension and are required.

Next, there's the `manifest_version`. This field is essential for defining which
manifest.json version the browser should interpret. If your curious about which
versions are compatibile with which browsers, check out the docs
[here][manifest-compatibility].

Based on the manifest_version, the next field can be either `action` or
`browser_action`. Each of which preforms the same action. This field's content
is responsible for creating the actual icon and title of the extension within
the browser's toolbar. It's also responsible for creating a pointer to our
Next.js application.

## Bundling The Application

Before testing our extension, we must first bundle the Next.js application. This
can be done by running the following commands:

```bash
npx next build
npx next export
```

Once complete, we should see an `/out` directory. It contains the bundled
version of our Next.js application as well as our manifest.json. Think of this
directory as the source code of our extension.

> If your using _Firefox_, please skip to the next section! The following only
> applies to Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Brave).

Before importing our extension into the browser, we must address one issue.
Directories and files prefixed with an underscore (`\_`) are reserved by system.

This conflicts with a bundled Next.js application since its root directory is
`\_next`. To resolve this issue, we can run the following command to replace all
instances of '\_next' with 'next':

```bash
# Windows/Linux
mv ./out/_next ./out/next && cd ./out && grep -rl '/_next' * | xargs sed -i 's|/_next|/next|g'

# MacOS
mv ./out/_next ./out/next && cd ./out && grep -rli '_next' * | xargs -I@ sed -i '' 's|/_next|/next|g' @;
```

## Testing In Browser

We've now successfully prepared our Next.js application to be embedded within an
extension! Our last step is to simply import it into the browser to test:

> Please note, we will _not_ cover publishing an extension to the browser's
> marketplace. However, there are plenty of resources available on this subject.

<div>
  <details>
    <summary>Chrome</summary>

    1. Navigate to: chrome://extensions
    2. Toggle on 'Developer Mode' in the top right corner.
    3. Click the 'Load Unpacked' button.
    4. Select your /out directory.

  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Firefox</summary>

    1. Navigate to: about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
    2. Click the 'Load Temporary Add-on...' button.
    3. Select your manifest.json file.

  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Edge</summary>

    1. Navigate to: edge://extensions/
    2. Toggle on 'Developer Mode' in the left panel.
    3. Click the 'Load Unpacked' button.
    4. Select your /out directory.

  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Opera</summary>

    1. Navigate to: opera://extensions
    2. Toggle on 'Developer Mode' in the top right corner.
    3. Click the 'Load Unpacked' button.
    4. Select your /out directory.

  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Brave</summary>

    1. Navigate to: brave://extensions
    2. Toggle on 'Developer Mode' in the top right corner.
    3. Click the 'Load Unpacked' button.
    4. Select your /out directory.

  </details>
</div>

## Remarks

Overall, extensions are fantastic tools that undoubtedly excel web development
and general productivity.

The requirements for building an extension are as simple as its gets:
HTML/CSS/JavaScript... and a manifest.json. With this simplicity, it unlocks the
capability to embed rich/complex web applications.

With a more rich/complex web application comes the ability to solve more niche
solutions not offered by browsers out of the box.
